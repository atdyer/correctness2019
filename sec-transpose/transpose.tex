\section{Matrix Transpose}
\label{sec:transpose}

Abstract matrix transpose can be performed ``en masse'' using set comprehension.  The CSR transpose algorithm, on the other hand, involves nested loops with dependencies, shown in \figurename~\ref{algo:transpose}.

Have modeled transpose using a method similar to the \texttt{kpos} method used in ELL to CSR translation that does, but have also demonstrated a way to generate a table of iteration steps -- still in development and method is being refined.

The algorithm consists of four distinct steps: (1) counting of columns, (2) calculation of pointers, (3) copying of values, and (4) shifting of pointers.  An array, $iao$, evolved continuously through this process and is used in all four steps.  We are mostly concerned with the third step, as it contains an inner loop that has a dependency on the outer loop, seen in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:transpose}.

The first and fourth steps make use of set comprehensions, the second step uses a common modeling paradigm to generate values, but the third step requires the final method introduced in this paper.  Rather than generate a sequence of integers, as in kpos method, generate a sequence of arrays.  This method demonstrated in the \texttt{copyvals} predicate in \figurename~\ref{model:transpose}.  May move this method of generating a sequence of arrays to be included with the kpos method, depending on the final form of the table-of-iterations method.
